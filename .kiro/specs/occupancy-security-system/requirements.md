# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a 3-camera occupancy and security system designed for real-time people counting, security monitoring, and alert management. The system will monitor entrance and lounge zones, provide accurate headcount tracking, and deliver timely alerts when occupancy thresholds are exceeded. The solution prioritizes on-premises deployment with optional cloud telemetry and includes a comprehensive security dashboard for monitoring and incident management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time People Detection and Counting

**User Story:** As a facility manager, I want real-time people counting across multiple camera zones, so that I can monitor occupancy levels and ensure compliance with capacity limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a person enters or exits any monitored zone THEN the system SHALL update the headcount within 2 seconds
2. WHEN multiple cameras detect the same person THEN the system SHALL de-duplicate the count using short-window re-identification
3. WHEN the system is tracking fewer than 30 people THEN the accuracy SHALL be within Â±2 people
4. WHEN the system is tracking 30 or more people THEN the accuracy SHALL be within 10% of actual count
5. WHEN a camera feed is interrupted THEN the system SHALL detect the offline status and attempt auto-recovery within 60 seconds

### Requirement 2: Threshold-based Alert System

**User Story:** As a security operator, I want automated alerts when occupancy exceeds safe limits, so that I can take immediate action to manage crowd levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN occupancy exceeds 40 people for 3 consecutive seconds THEN the system SHALL trigger an alert
2. WHEN an alert is triggered THEN the system SHALL deliver notifications via WhatsApp, SMS, and email within 10 seconds
3. WHEN multiple threshold breaches occur THEN the system SHALL implement rate-limiting to prevent alert spam
4. WHEN camera hardware goes offline THEN the system SHALL send immediate "camera offline" alerts
5. IF alert delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry using alternative notification channels

### Requirement 3: Security Dashboard and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a security operator, I want a comprehensive dashboard to monitor live occupancy, view trends, and manage security events, so that I can maintain situational awareness and respond effectively to incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time headcount for each monitored zone
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show camera health status and connection state
3. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL log all events with timestamps and allow CSV export
4. WHEN an alert is received THEN security operators SHALL be able to acknowledge it within 2 clicks
5. WHEN acknowledging alerts THEN the system SHALL allow operators to add notes and escalate incidents
6. WHEN viewing historical data THEN the system SHALL display occupancy trends and patterns

### Requirement 4: Multi-Camera Zone Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure and manage multiple camera zones with specific regions of interest, so that I can optimize detection accuracy for different areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring cameras THEN the system SHALL support RTSP camera connections for entrance and lounge zones
2. WHEN setting up detection zones THEN the system SHALL provide a configuration UI for defining regions of interest (ROIs)
3. WHEN cameras are deployed THEN the system SHALL support entrance line detection for accurate in/out counting
4. WHEN configuring thresholds THEN the system SHALL allow customizable occupancy limits per zone
5. WHEN managing recipients THEN the system SHALL provide configuration for alert notification recipients

### Requirement 5: System Reliability and Recovery

**User Story:** As a facility operator, I want the system to automatically recover from failures and maintain continuous operation, so that monitoring is not interrupted by technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN camera connections are lost THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection within 60 seconds
2. WHEN the MQTT broker restarts THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and resume operations
3. WHEN system components fail THEN watchdog processes SHALL detect failures and restart services
4. WHEN the system starts up THEN all camera feeds SHALL be validated and connection status reported
5. IF auto-recovery fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and alert administrators

### Requirement 6: Optional Biometric Authentication (Add-on Module)

**User Story:** As a security manager, I want staff attendance tracking and watchlist monitoring at the entrance, so that I can manage access control and identify persons of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN staff members approach the entrance THEN the system SHALL perform biometric identification for attendance tracking
2. WHEN unknown individuals are detected THEN the system SHALL check against a narrow watchlist database
3. WHEN enrolling new staff THEN the system SHALL capture and store encrypted biometric embeddings
4. WHEN processing biometric data THEN the system SHALL include liveness detection to prevent spoofing
5. WHEN watchlist matches occur THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts with human review workflow
6. WHEN biometric events occur THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed audit logs for compliance

### Requirement 7: Data Privacy and On-Premises Operation

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the system to operate primarily on-premises with minimal cloud dependencies, so that sensitive video data remains under our control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing video feeds THEN the system SHALL perform all detection and analysis on local hardware
2. WHEN storing biometric data THEN the system SHALL use encrypted embeddings without storing raw images
3. IF cloud telemetry is enabled THEN the system SHALL only send metadata and statistics, never video content
4. WHEN configuring deployment THEN the system SHALL support 100% on-premises operation with zero cloud dependencies
5. WHEN using optional AWS telemetry THEN the system SHALL limit data to IoT metrics and time-series data only

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to handle multiple camera feeds efficiently while maintaining real-time performance, so that detection accuracy is not compromised by processing delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing 3 concurrent RTSP streams THEN the system SHALL maintain real-time detection with <2 second latency
2. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL maintain detection accuracy within specified tolerances
3. WHEN storing historical data THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage data retention and cleanup
4. WHEN multiple users access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL support concurrent access without performance degradation
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL export data within reasonable time limits based on data volume
